    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A single layer perceptron can be thought of as a linear hyperplane as in logistic regression followed by a non-linear activation function. $$u_{i} = \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{d} \\theta_{ij}x_{j}+b_{i}$$  $$o_{i} = \\phi \\left( \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^{d} \\theta_{ij}x_{j}+b_{i} \\right) = \\phi(\\theta_{i}^{T}x+b_{i})$$ where $x$ is a d-dimensional vector i.e. $x \\in R^{d}$. It is one datapoint with $d$ features. $\\theta_{i} \\in R^{d}$ is the weight vector for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit, $b_{i} \\in R$ is the bias element for the $i^{th}$ hidden unit and $\\phi(.)$ is a non-linear activation function that has been described below. $u_{i}$ is a linear combination of the features in $x_j$ weighted by $\\theta_{i}$ whereas $o_{i}$ is the $i^{th}$ output unit from the activation layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fully connected Layer\n",
    "Typically, a modern neural network contains millions of perceptrons as the one shown in the previous image. Perceptrons interact in different configurations such as cascaded or parallel. In this part, we describe a fully connected layer configuration in a neural network which comprises multiple parallel perceptrons forming one layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We extend the previous notation to describe a fully connected layer. Each layer in a fully connected network has a number of input/hidden/output units cascaded in parallel. Let us a define a single layer of the neural net as follows: <br>\n",
    "$m$ demotes the number of hidden units in a single layer $l$ whereas $n$ denotes the number of units in the previous layer $l-1$.\n",
    "$$u^{[l]}=\\theta^{[l]}o^{[l-1]}+b^{[l]}$$ where $u^{[l]} \\in R^{m}$ is a m-dimensional vector pertaining to the hidden units of the $l^{th}$ layer of the neural network after applying linear operations. Similarly, $o^{[l-1]}$ is the n-dimensional output vector corresponding to the hidden units of the $(l-1)^{th}$ activation layer. $\\theta^{[l]} \\in R^{m \\times n}$ is the weight matrix of the $l^{th}$ layer where each row of $\\theta^{[l]}$ is analogous to $\\theta_{i}$ described in the previous section i.e. each row corresponds to one hidden unit of the $l^{th}$ layer. $b^{[l]} \\in R^{m}$ is the bias vector of the layer where each element of b pertains to one hidden unit of the $l^{th}$ layer. This is followed by element wise non-linear activation function $o^{[l]} = \\phi(u^{[l]})$.\n",
    "The whole operation can be summarized as,\n",

    "## Activation Function \n",
    "There are many activation functions in the literature but for this question we are going to use Relu and Tanh only. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span>**HINT 1: When calculating the tanh and relu function, make sure you are not modifying the values in the original passed in matrix. You may find np.copy() helpful.**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relu\n",
    "The rectified linear unit (Relu) is one of the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning models. The mathematical form is $$o = \\phi(u) = max(0,u)$$One of the advantages of Relu is that it is a fast nonlinearity. <br> The derivative of relu function is given as $o' = \\phi'(u) = \\begin{cases}\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tanh\n",
    "Tanh also known as hyperbolic tangent is like a shifted version of sigmoid activation function with its range going from -1 to 1. Tanh almost always proves to be better than the sigmoid function since the mean of the activations are closer to zero. Tanh has an effect of centering data that makes learning for the next layer a bit easier. The mathematical form of tanh is given as $$o = \\phi(u) = tanh(u) = \\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}$$ The derivative of tanh is given as $$o' = \\phi'(u) = 1 - {\\left(\\frac{e^{u} - e^{-u}}{e^{u} + e^{-u}}\\right)}^{2} = 1 - o^{2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sigmoid\n",
    "The sigmoid function is another non-linear function with S-shaped curve. This function is useful in the case of binary classification as its output is between 0 and 1. The mathematical form of the function is $$o = \\phi(u)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}$$<br> The derivation of the sigmoid function has a nice form and is given as $$o' = \\phi'(u) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{1+e^{-u}}\\right) = \\phi(u)(1-\\phi(u))$$\n",

    "## Mean Squared Error \n",
    "\n",
    "It is an estimator that measures the average of the squares of the errors i.e. the average squared difference between the actual and the estimated values. It estimates the quality of the learnt hypothesis between the actual and the predicted values. It's non-negative and closer to zero, the better the learnt function is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation details\n",
    "For regression problems as in this exercise, we compute the loss as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$MSE = \\frac{1}{2N}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i} -  \\hat{y_{i}}\\right)^{2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forward Propagation\n",
    "We start by initializing the weights of the fully connected layer using Xavier initialization [Xavier initialization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf). During training, we pass all the data points through the network layer by layer using forward propagation. The main equations for forward prop have been described below. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backward propagation\n",
    "After the forward pass, we do back propagation to update the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. So, we update the weights and biases using the following formulas\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

Similarly for calculating other partial derivatives, we store the values we'll be needing for chain rule in cache.

    "\n",
    "In this question, you will implement a two layer fully connected neural network. You will also experiment with different activation functions and optimization techniques. Functions with comments \"TODO: implement this\" are for you to implement. We provide two activation functions here - Relu and Tanh. You will implement a neural network that would have tanh activation followed by relu layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also implement Gradient Descent (GD) and Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) algorithms for training these neural nets. **GD is mandatory for all. BGD is bonus for undergraduate students but mandatory for graduate students.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In the <strong>NN.py</strong> file, complete the following functions:\n",
    "  * <strong>Relu</strong>: Recall Hint 1\n",
    "  * <strong>Tanh</strong>: Recall Hint 1\n",
    "  * <strong>nloss</strong>\n",
    "  * <strong>forward</strong>\n",
    "  * <strong>backward</strong>: Recall Hint 2\n",
    "  * <strong>gradient_descent</strong>\n",
    "  * <strong>batch_gradient_descent</strong>:<span style=\"color:darkred\"> **Mandatory for graduate students, bonus for undergraduate students.**</span> Please batch your data in a wraparound manner. For example, given a dataset of 9 numbers, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and a batch size of 6, the first iteration batch will be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the second iteration batch will be [7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3], the third iteration batch will be [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train this neural net on sklearn's diabetes dataset. Graduate students have to use both GD and BGD to optimize their neural net. Undergraduate students have to implement GD while BGD is bonus for them.  Note: it is possible you'll run into nan or negative values for loss. This happens because of the small dataset we're using and some numerical stability issues that arise due to division by zero, natural log of zeros etc. You can experiment with the total number of iterations to mitigate this. \n",
    "\n",
    "You're free to tune hyperparameters like the batch size, number of hidden units in each layer etc. if that helps you in achieving the desired MSE values to pass the autograder tests. However, you're advised to try out the default values first. \n",

But, as this gradient keeps flowing backwards to the initial layers, this value keeps getting multiplied by each local gradient. Hence, the gradient becomes smaller and smaller, making the updates to the initial layers very small, increasing the training time considerably.\n",

    "\n",
    "While building tree-based models, it's common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in a decision tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use \"Gini importance\", or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in a decision tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the decision tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on \"pH\" in a decision tree trained on our water dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on \"pH\" will result in a high feature importance value for \"pH\". This could mean \"pH\" is a very important feature for predicting the level of potability for water. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on \"Sulfate\" in a decision tree (few samples will reach this split for a decision) and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on \"Sulfate\" will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean \"Sulfate\" is not a very informative feature for predicting the level of potability in our decision tree. **Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to a dataset auomatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the decision tree and stores these values in a **feature_importances_** variable. [Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.feature_importances_)\n",

By mapping the current feature x to a higher space with more features, linear SVM could be performed on the features in the higher space to learn a non-linear decision boundary.
